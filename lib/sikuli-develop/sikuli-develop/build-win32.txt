= How To Build Sikuli on Windows =

Prerequisite: 
   Visual C++ 
   JDK 6
   CMake 2.8+
   OpenCV 2.1+
   Tesseract-OCR 2.04 source code + English language data (3.0 won't work), 
   SWIG 1.3+


The path to these dependent libraries can be set in cmake_modules/common.cmake.
You may need to add appropriate paths on your machine if cmake can not find 
the libraries automatically.


Note for old sikuli users: Cygwin is not required anymore. Sikuli can be 
built with only Visual C++ and NMake (included in VC++) now.

Assume you are in the top directory of Sikuli's source tree. You can
build Sikuli IDE and Sikuli Script with the following steps.

0. Open the Visual Studio command prompt

1. make a "build" directory in sikuli-script/
  mkdir sikuli-script/build

2. generate makefiles with CMake
  cd sikuli-script/build
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

3. build sikuli-script
  nmake

4. make a "build" directory in sikuli-ide/
  cd ../.. # go back to the top directory 
  mkdir sikuli-ide/build

5. generate makefiles of Sikuli-IDE with CMake
  cd sikuli-ide/build
  cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

6. generate a release package of sikuli-ide.
  nmake package
